/**
 * Fee payment method for PrivateFPC that bundles FeeJuice.claim +
 * mint_and_pay_fee in a single transaction setup phase.
 *
 * Enables cold-start fee sponsorship directly from a L1 bridge deposit,
 * with no prior `mint` call needed. The caller's wallet only needs to
 * have done the L1 deposit; the L2 claim and FJ credit happen atomically here.
 *
 * The payment calls (in order):
 *   1. FeeJuice.claim(fpcAddress, amount, secret, leafIndex)
 *      - Consumes the L1→L2 message; emits the FeeJuice nullifier.
 *   2. PrivateFPC.mint_and_pay_fee(amount, salt, leafIndex)
 *      - Asserts the FeeJuice nullifier exists (pending from step 1).
 *      - Credits (amount - max_gas_cost) to msg_sender.
 *      - Sets PrivateFPC as fee payer and ends setup.
